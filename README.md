# COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL

This project uses SQL to explore and analyze global COVID-19 data, focusing on cases, deaths, population impact, and vaccination trends across countries and continents.

## 📂 Project Contents

- `covid_analysis.sql` — Core SQL script with all queries used for analysis
- `covid_data.csv` — (Optional) Sample dataset used (if included)
- `vaccination_data.json` — (Optional) Supplemental data

## 🔧 SQL Skills Demonstrated

- ✅ Joins (INNER JOIN)
- ✅ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- ✅ Temporary Tables
- ✅ Aggregate Functions (`SUM`, `MAX`, etc.)
- ✅ Window Functions (`OVER`, `PARTITION BY`)
- ✅ Views
- ✅ Type Casting (`CAST()`)

## 🔍 Key Analyses

- Infection rate vs. population across countries
- Death percentage per case globally and by country
- Total and rolling vaccination counts
- Continent-level death aggregation
- Global case and death trend by date
- Final vaccination percentage by country

## 📊 Example Insights

- Which countries had the highest death rate?
- What percent of a country’s population got infected?
- How quickly did vaccinations roll out over time?

## 🛠 Tools

- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible)
- Git / GitHub for version control

## 📁 Setup

You can run these queries on any relational database after importing the datasets:
- `CovidDeaths`
- `CovidVaccinations`

Make sure the date formats and column names match those expected in the SQL file.
